At first, understand what this agent is doing, what it's purpose and what this is capable of.

Then think if we are missing any critical flow in this. One such flow is tracking the replies on comments we posted though this agent.

As of now, we just post a comment or reply to a comment in a post with our flow. This is not sufficient, we shall also track how users are responding to it. If users are downvoting it. If users are praising this or saying something negavtive in replies.

Can you create a plan that identifies such loopholes as well create a plan to mitigate the "feedback on Agent posted comments" flow as well.

Make sure it is end to end applicable and end to end testable and scalable as well.
